    <p>

Have you ever seen someone complete a mural and wonder how they go from scribbles on a wall to a final piece? Well rest assured that you’re not the only one baffled by this process. One of the most used techniques in murals now a days is something called “the doodle grid”. As the name suggests, it’s a process of scribbling words and doodles on a wall, mixed with a little help from technology, this process helps build a guide to your final mural product! Often this is something you’ll see when someone is starting a mural with a “doodle grid”.
</p>
	  <div class="doodle" align="center">
	  <img  src="IMG_3724.jpg" alt="Doodlegrid" width="30%" class="doodle" align="center">
	  </div>
	   <p>
This process works best when you have an image that you have on some sort of device that you want to paint to scale on your mural surface. The trick is using your device to guide you to paint to scale with your image having reduced opacity, you place it on top of a photo of your mural space and use you doodles as “anchor” like point to guide you on where lines or colors need to be. Below, to the left is an example of an original image set up on top of the mural space photo as explained above. And to the right is an image of the sketch process starting, using the doodles as guides.

	  <img  src="IMG_3721.JPG" alt="continueddoodle" width="30%"  align="center">
		  <img src="IMG_4910.jpg" alt="continued doodle2" width="30%" align="center">
		  
		  <p>
The goal here is to use these doodles and your device as a tool to get a final product that is as close to your reference as possible. This process really helps production speed because sometimes you don’t have the time to map everything out slowly. If you have a small budget you’re working with, or if you’re in a space where you only have a few days, this helps you lay down your sketch really fast and get to your finished product efficiently. If you have a phone or tablet you can use this process. Apps or programs like procreate, procreate pocket, photoshop, or other basic photo editors will allow you to use this process seamlessly. I hope that if you are struggling to find a way to get your murals closer to how you want them to look or you’re just looking for a new process to fancy to, this one will be an exciting new venture for you! Below is a final product using this process!
